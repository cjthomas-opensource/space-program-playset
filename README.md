# Space Program Playset Project

## Overview

This project offers CAD files and STL meshes for model kits and play-set
components inspired by the first Kerbal Space Program game.

I am not the world's best artist or sculptor. I encourage people who are
better artists than I am to fork the project (or make new projects) with
fancier components based on the simple ones I've provided here. My focus
was on getting component assembly working properly.

The CAD files were made using FreeCAD. I have a love/hate relationship
with that program; use it if and only if you're willing to put up with its
quirks. The IGES files can be imported into any other CAD program, and
should let you make your own variants of the parts without having to fight
with FreeCAD.

**NOTE** - Anything recognizably from _Kerbal Space Program_, as opposed to
resembling historical spacecraft, is likely to be covered by trademarks from
that game. I've taken care not to duplicate those here.  Don't duplicate
these in your own projects either, unless you have permission from the
trademark holder. Also don't use textures, meshes, or other art assets from
the game - those are covered by copyright, and will likewise need permission
from the copyright holder.

There may be similar issues with making close duplicates of real spacecraft.
Some of these are freely usable, others aren't, and it's up to you to find
out which you can duplicate before doing so. I've avoided doing that here,
with the exception of historical NASA spacecraft (which had an explicit
exemption, which may or may not apply to more recent NASA spacecraft).

## Using the Pieces

The parts described as "models" are intended to be glued together and then
painted. The parts described as "play-sets" are intended to snap together,
and may be pre-coloured or pre-painted. There's a bit of overlap: certain
parts of the model set (such as decouplers) are intended to be detachable
after assembly.

My usual printing service is Shapeways, using their "versatile plastic"
SLS nylon process. The parts should print as-is with that process. For
filament-printing, you may need to scale up the parts to 150% or 200%,
depending on your printer.

These parts pretty much have to be 3d printed. Making them compatible with
injection molding would impose substantial constraints on geometry, and
virtually all parts would have to be heavily modified. So, for now, the
parts are print-only.

## Folders

* The `release` folder contains archives with files for the various model
kits and play-sets. If you want to print or import the kits, these are the
only files you should need.

* The `cad-model-shapes` folder contains CAD files for basic shapes and for
the linking components used for model assembly.

* The `cad-model-basic` folder contains CAD files for model components
using a very simple art style.

* The `reference-pics` folder contains reference diagrams and photographs of
specific spacecraft and space science instruments. **NOTE** - These are
not released under the project license. For license information, check the
associated government agencies or commercial agencies.

* The `reference-notes` folder contains other reference material.
