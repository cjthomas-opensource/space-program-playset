Calculations based on strain in a curve of constant radius gives:

Arm thickness t, length l, displacement d.

Approximate relations:

l = r * theta
d = (1/2) r * theta^2
(delta-l) = (1/2) t * theta

...For plastic, keep (delta-l)/l less than 0.03. For metal, less than 0.01.


Solving gives:

(delta-l)/l = t * d / l^2

l^2 * [ (delta-l) / l ] = t * d

...Fix all but one component and solve for the remaining one.
